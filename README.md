# Quinifier

Quines (self-replicating programs) have the source code encoded as part of the source code, so it doesn't need to read any file to get the source code. The latter is impossible if the quine is compiled and the source code file is deleted.

The quinifier turns the target program into a quine. Now every time it's run, it does what it used to do, and then prints an exact copy of itself.

Partly done to expose myself to React, Docker, and AWS.
